namespace app {

    use \bootphp\loader\AppLoader;
    use \bootphp\fn;

    include_once "lib/autoload.php";

    class Index extends AppLoader
    {
        public $title = "DEFAULT_TITLE";

        public function __construct()
        {
            // TODO: Something you want to do before I do something.
            fn::println("__construct");
            fn::println("Title in query is " . $this->title);
            fn::println("Title2 in query is " . $this->title2);
            fn::println("Title3 in query is " . $this->title3);
        }

        public function invoke($options)
        {
            // TODO: What you want to do?.
            // You can access all Query params here as instance properties like : $this->title
            fn::println("invoke");
            fn::println("Title in query is " . $this->title);
            fn::println("Title2 in query is " . $this->title2);
